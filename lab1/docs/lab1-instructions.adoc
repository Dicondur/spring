= Lab 1: Getting Started with Spring and Spring Boot

In this lab, you will learn the basics of Spring development and how to get started with a Spring Boot project. 

== Background

In the past Spring has gotten a lot of criticism for beeing hard to get started with. This has however been addressed by the Spring community with the Spring Boot project and the Spring Initalizer service hosted at http://start.spring.io. However booth Spring Boot and Spring Initalizer takes an opinonated approach to which frameworks and 3rd party library to use. In a similar manner Red Hat provides a service at launch.opeenshift.io that will take an opinionated approach at which frameworks and target platfrom (OpenShift) you are developing for. 

Since this lab aims to teach you have to work with existing Spring application and run it on RHOAR we are going to use the Spring Initalizer. Alternatively we could have used launch.openshift.io or JBoss Forge to initiate the project, however that would have shortcutted some of the steps that are important for your understanding of how to run Spring on RHOAR.

= Steps

:numbered:

== Initiate the project using Spring Initalizer

1. Open a browser to http://start.spring.io and enter the following information

+
Generate a **Maven project** with **Java** and Spring Boot **1.5.4**
+
[options="header,footer,autowidth"]
|=======
|Attribute|Value
|Group |com.redhat.coolstore
|Artifact |product-catalog
|Dependencies | _Leave Blank_
|=======

1. Click Generate project
1. Open a terminal and unzip the downloaded project
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p ~/rhoar-training/spring
cd ~/rhoar-training/spring
unzip ~/Downloads/product-catalog.zip 
----

1. Test to build the project  
+
[source,bash]
----
cd product-catalog
mvn clean package
----

== Create your first Component

1. Create a Java class named `ProductCatalogService` in package `com.redhat.coolstore.productcatalog`

1. Annotate the class with `@Component` and the following import statement `import org.springframework.stereotype.Component`

1. Add a **public** method called `sayHello` returning a `String` like this
+
[source,java]
---- 
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
----

1. Inject the component into the `ProductCatalogApplicationTests`
+
[source,java]
---- 
    @Autowired
    ProductCatalogService service
----
+
Note: Autowire annotation requires that you add `import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;`

1. Add a test method called `testDefaultProudctList`
+
[source,java]
---- 
	@Test
    public void testDefaultProductList() {
        String message = service.sayHello();
        assertTrue(message!=null);
        assertEquals(message,"Hello World!");
    }
----
+
NOTE: This requires that you add the following import statements `import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;` and `import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;`

1. Run the tests either in your IDE or from commandline like this
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn verify
----

You can now inject a component with @Autowired annotation, similary to how CDI works in Java EE. If you are a Java EE developer you would probably prefer to use the JSR-330 standard annotation `@Inject` instead of `@Autowired` which is also supported by Spring. Let's change the test class to use @Inject instead.

1. Add the following dependency to the `pom.xml` in the `<dependencies>` section.
+
[source,xml]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>javax.inject</groupId>
            <artifactId>javax.inject</artifactId>
            <version>1</version>
        </dependency>
----

1. Change `ProductCatalogApplicationTest` and replace the `@Autowired` with `@Inject` and `import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;` with `import javax.inject.Inject;`

1. Run the tests either in your IDE or from commandline again and verify that the `@Inject` works.
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn verify
----

== Use environment specific application properties

1. Change the `ProductCatalogService` class and add the following class variable:
+
[source,java]
---- 
    @Value("${coolstore.message:'Hello World!'}")
    String message;
----
+
NOTE: The `@Value` annotations namespace is `org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value`

1. Update the `sayHello` class method of `ProductCatalogService` to return the `message` member variable
+
[source,java]
---- 
    public String sayHello() {
        return message;
    }
----
+

1. Test the change
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn verify
----

=== Add dev specific message
Lets update the test class to use a profile called `dev` that should result in `Hey Developer!` as message

1. Add annotation to `@ActiveProfiles("dev")` to the class `ProductCatalogApplicationTests`

1. Change the `assertEquals` test string to `Hey Developer!`

1. Run the test 
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn verify
----
+
NOTE: This test should fail since we haven't updated the implementation yet.

1. Add a new properties file called `src/main/resources/application-dev.properties` with the following content

[source,properties]
----
coolstore.message=Hey Developer!
----

1. Run the test 
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn verify
----
+
NOTE: This time the test should execute successful

== Add REST capabilities using Apache CXF

At this stage our product catalog service can only say hello and it does not expose any external endpoints. In this section we will add REST support and provide a list of product names.

1. Apache CXF is tested and verfied with version 1.4.1 of Spring Boot, change the `spring-boot-starter-paren` version in the `pom.xml` to `1.4.1.RELEASE`.

1. Also in `pom.xml` add dependencies to Apache CXF as below:
+
[source,xml]
----
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
			<artifactId>cxf-spring-boot-starter-jaxrs</artifactId>
			<version>3.1.10</version>
		</dependency>
----

1. Open `ProductCatalogService` and add `@Path("/products")` as class annotation and add the following method
+
[source,java]
----
    @GET
	public Response list() {
		return Response.ok(message,MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON).build();
	}
----
+
NOTE: The `@Path` annotations namespace is `javax.ws.rs.Path`
+
NOTE: The `@GET` annotations namespace is `javax.ws.rs.GET`
+
NOTE: The `Response` class namespace is `javax.ws.rs.core.Response`
+
NOTE: The `MediaType` class namespace is `javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType`

1. Add the following configuration to `src/main/resources/application.properties`
+
[source,properties]
----
cxf.path=/services
cxf.jaxrs.component-scan=true
cxf.jaxrs.classes-scan-packages=com.redhat.coolstore.productcatalog
----

1. Build and run the application
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

1. Test the endpoint in another terminal using curl
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/services/products
----
+
NOTE: The expected output should be `Hello World!`

1. Go back to the original terminal and stop the application using `CTRL-C``

1. Run the application, but this time activate the `dev` profile
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
---- 

1. Test the endpoint in another terminal using curl
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/services/products
----
+
NOTE: The expected output should be `Hey Developer!`

1. Go back to the original terminal and stop the application using `CTRL-C`

=== Add support Jackson JAX-RS binding
Default Apache CXF relies on Jettison 1.3 as JSON provider, but one can also use Jackson provide. Which one to choose is a mater of taste, but Jettison supports only JAXB annotated beans. Since we want to avoid additional annotation or transformation object we are going to use Jackson Provider instead.

1. Add Jackson dependency to the `pom.xml`
+
[source,xml]
----
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs</groupId>
			<artifactId>jackson-jaxrs-json-provider</artifactId>
		</dependency>
----

1. Create a configuration class called `ProductCatalogConfiguration` to configure the Jackson using a bean like this:
+
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.productcatalog;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs.json.JacksonJaxbJsonProvider;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs.json.JacksonJsonProvider;

@Configuration
public class ProductCatalogConfiguration {
	
	@Bean
	public JacksonJsonProvider jsonProvider(ObjectMapper objectMapper) {
		JacksonJaxbJsonProvider provider = new JacksonJaxbJsonProvider();
		provider.setMapper(objectMapper);
		return provider;
    }
    
}
----

1. Build and run the application
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

1. Test the endpoint in another terminal using curl
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/services/products
----
+
NOTE: The expected output should be `Hello World!`

= Summary
In this lab you have learned how to create component and how to configure that component for different environments using the configuration api. Then you learned hot to expose the component as a REST service that can be called using standad http protocol. Finally you learned how to add Jackson Json  provider that we are going to be useful in future next labs.
